P(A) = Probability of Event A
0 <= P(A) <= 1
The set of all possible outcomes must have a probability of 1

P(A^c) = P(not A) it's the complement of A

Complement Rule:
P(A)+P(A^c) = 1
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)

P(A) + P(not A) = 1
P(not A) = 1 - P(A)


Addition Rule:
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) if A and B are disjoint (if there's no overlap)

P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) if A and B are not disjoint (if there's overlap)


with replacement(place the drawn card back in the deck) 
without replacement(total size of set is lowered)
Independent: the second event is independent from the first event
P(Ace and Heart) = P(Ace) * P(Heart)


Independence: do previous events affect future events

if P(B) == P(B|A): independent
if P(B) != P(B|A): dependent


Let "E" represent the current event
Let "P" represent the previous event, if it exists

    If an event occurs independently, continue with P(E)

    If an event occurs with dependence, continue with P(E|P)

        P(E|P) means E given P has occurred

        example: drawing numbers when playing bingo, since the numbers aren't placed back into the container, the set size decreases incrementally


if disjoint, use or, not exclusive or



P(A or B)  = P(A) + P(B)

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) 

P(A xor B) = P(A or B) - P(A and B)

P(not A)   = 1 - P(A)
