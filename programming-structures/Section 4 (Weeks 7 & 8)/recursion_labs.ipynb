For example, the digits of 1234 add up to 1+2+3+4 = 10.\n\nThe challenge is: how do you break a number apart into digits without converting it to a string? Think about what the “last digit” means in terms of division and remainders, and how you could keep peeling off digits until nothing is left.\nWrite a function that takes a non-negative integer and returns the sum of its digits.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Assume `n` is a non‑negative integer.\n- Do **not** use `str(n)`.\n",
